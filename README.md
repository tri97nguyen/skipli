NOTE: please change the twilio auth token and account id in backend/services/twilio.js to the ones I sent in email. Twilio will automatically revoke my Twilio token if I push it onto github.

To run server: `cd backend/` and type `npm run`
To run client: `cd frontend/` and type `npm run`

Server will run on port 3000 and client on port 3001. So make sure you have nothing on these ports.

main code for app is in backend/services/ and backend/routes/message.js

For frontend it is frontend/src/Form.js
