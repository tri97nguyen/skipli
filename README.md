NOTE: please change the twilio auth token and account id in the first 2 lines in backend/services/twilio.js to the ones I sent in email. Twilio will automatically revoke my Twilio token if I push it onto github.

install dependencies: \
`cd backend/` and type `npm i`\
`cd frontend/` and type `npm i`

To run server: `cd backend/` and type `npm run`
To run client: `cd frontend/` and type `npm run`

Make sure to start the server first before client. The server runs on port 3000. The server will ask to run on another port. Type "y" when prompted when it ask to run on another port.

main code for app is in backend/services/ and backend/routes/message.js

For frontend it is frontend/src/Form.js
